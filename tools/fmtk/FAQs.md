**Q1: What is FX300?**

The F300 FPGA accelerator card (FX300) is a half-height half-length (HHHL) single-slot PCIe card based on the Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ XCVU5P FPGA chip. It supports PCIe 3.0 x16 ports and provides two 100GE QSFP28 optical ports. The FX300 is a standard PCIe card and can be used on Huawei servers or standard servers of other vendors.

**Q2: What is FX600?**

The F600 FPGA accelerator card (FX600) is a full-height 3/4-length single-slot PCIe card based on the Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ XCVU9P FPGA chip. It supports PCIe 3.0 x16 ports and provides two 100GE QSFP28 optical ports. The FX600 is a standard PCIe card and can be used on Huawei servers or standard servers of other vendors.

**Q3: What is Shell?**

Shell is the static logic provided by the HDK, including peripheral interfaces such as PCIe and DDR4.

**Q4: What is firmware validation?**

After Golden and Shell are upgraded, invoke the APIs to make the upgraded firmware take effect.

**Q5: What is firmware reloading?**

Firmware reloading is to load the firmware from a specified flash area by invoking the APIs.

**Q6: What information do the details provide?**

The details provide the electronic label information, optical module information, DIMM information, power, voltage, and temperature.

**Q7: When is the health status available?**

The health status applies only when the OCL logic provided by Huawei is uploaded to the FX300 or FX600.
