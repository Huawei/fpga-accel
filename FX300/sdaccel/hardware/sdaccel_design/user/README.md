# Creating a User Project
  There are two methods for creating a user project:

  * Copy an example project. Modify parameters and add functional modules as required.

  * Create a project and add user-developed code to the compilation environment as required.

  * The first method allows users to quickly implement a project, and the second requires users to compile code.
